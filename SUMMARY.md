## Performance Improvements

The refactored implementation offers several performance improvements:
- More efficient memory usage
- Better parallelization
- Optimized kernel launch configurations
- Support for newer GPU architectures
- Enhanced batch processing

## CuPy Integration

The new Python bindings include CuPy integration, which provides:
- Seamless handling of GPU arrays
- Reduced data transfer overhead
- Integration with the Python scientific ecosystem
- Simpler and more intuitive API

## Next Steps

While this refactoring provides a solid foundation, future improvements could include:
1. Multi-GPU support for very large batches
2. Tensor core optimization for applicable operations
3. Integration with PyTorch/TensorFlow for deep learning applications
4. Further kernel optimizations for specific architectures
5. JIT compilation for dynamic kernel generation
